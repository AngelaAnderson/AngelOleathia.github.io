        <p class="Summary">As the UX researcher and designer for this project, I was tasked with
          researching and identifying a target market that would benefit from a new cloud storage solution,
          develop a strong branding strategy, and ultimately bring a new, unique cloud storage solution to
          market. Considering the workload commonalities amongst creatives, this solution extends beyond
          basic cloud storage services to include customer relationship management (CRM) capabilities.</p>

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>Despite the vast amount of competition, the cloud storage market is still young and viable
              for new competitors given the right combination of features. This desired solution needed to
              leverage a “network effect,” by way of collaboration. More specifically, it needed to allow
              users to save content from the web, organize content using filters (such as categories, tags,
              groups etc.), create content, and upload files.</p>

          <div class="CSSolution">
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>The solution is Central. Central is a cloud storage and organization workspace that provides
              professional creatives with a convenient solution to managing projects and working relationships.</p>

          <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
          <p>The project kicked off by conducting a competitive analysis of key market competitors consisting of:
            Google Drive, Drop Box, and Evernote. While each of these competitors have numerous strengths that
            are advantageous for their brand, an analysis of their weaknesses presented an opportunity to create
            unique features specific to this new cloud storage solution. Some of the unique opportunities posed
            from the competitive analysis included: uploading and streaming music and video files, advanced
            organization, use of filters and tags, uploading file in the background, and Sorting files by date.</p>

          <h2>User Survey</h2>
          <p>After conducting market research, I conducted a user survey which aided in developing user personas.
            In total, 18 respondents completed the survey, providing a reasonable amount of data to analyze. Almost
            95% of respondents reported that they currently use or have you used Cloud Storage to store data. The 12
            respondents stated they utilize Google Drive, 7 respondents indicated they use iCloud, 5 indicated they use
            DropBox, and another 5 stated they use Microsoft One Drive. The majority of respondents indicated they use
            cloud storage almost every day for personal use, however, about 24% said they mainly use cloud storage for
            work. This data not only confirmed that cloud storage services are in high demand, but it also identified a
            niche market of professionals who could potentially benefit from this solution. </p>

          <h2>Typography</h2>
          <p>While pondering the ideal typography for this project, I knew I wanted to incorporate thin stokes into the design
            to keep the overall aesthetic simplistic and metaphorically connect back to the theme of creativity. I chose
            ParalucentStencil Light as my primary font as it communicates the theme of the brand well. However, the font is too
            overpowering to be used on text heavy pages. Thus, I paired it with Monsterrat Light to be used for headings and Acumin
            Pro Regular to be used for body text. All three fonts paired well, eliciting a modern and professional appearance.</p>

      <div class="Conclusion CSSection">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The research done in this project to create this solution has taught me a lot, enforcing the idea of designing with the user
          in mind. I’ve also have a better understanding of how brand messaging influences an over design. Initially, I tried incorporating
          illustrations into the design but found that it took away from a chic-professional appeal. I found it better to include photographs
          and geometric shapes to communicate professionalism while still inspiring creativity. Given more time, I would have thought out a plan
          to grow the collaboration and network feature. However, I find the CRM aspect of the solution a helpful tool that would be of value to
          professional creatives.</p>
