        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          As the UX researcher and designer for this project, I was tasked with researching
          and identifying a target market that would benefit from a new cloud storage solution,
           develop a strong branding strategy, and ultimately bring a new, unique cloud storage
           solution to market. Considering the workload commonalities amongst creatives, this
           solution extends beyond basic cloud storage services to include customer relationship
           management (CRM) capabilities.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="problem">
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Despite the vast amount of competition, the cloud storage market is still young and
          viable for new competitors given the right combination of features. This desired solution
          needed to leverage a “network effect,” by way of collaboration. More specifically, it
          needed to allow users to save content from the web, organize content using filters (such
          as categories, tags, groups etc.), create content, and upload files.
        </p>

            The solution is Central. Central is a cloud storage and organization workspace that
            provides professional creatives with a convenient solution to managing projects and
            working relationships. and upload files.

      <div class="CompetAnal">
        <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          The project was kicked off by conducting a competitive analysis of key market competitors
          consisting of: Google Drive, Drop Box, and Evernote. While each of these competitors have
          numerous strengths that are advantageous for their brand, an analysis of their weaknesses
          presented an opportunity to create unique features specific to this new cloud storage
          solution. Some of the unique opportunities posed from the competitive analysis included:
          uploading and streaming music and video files, advanced organization, use of filters and
          tags, uploading file in the background, and Sorting files by date.

      <div class="UserSurvey">
        <h2>User Survey</h2>
        <p>
          After conducting market research, I conducted a user survey which aided in developing user
          personas. In total, 18 respondents completed the survey, providing a reasonable amount of
          data to analyze. Almost 95% of respondents reported that they currently use or have you used
          Cloud Storage to store data. The 12 respondents stated they utilize Google Drive, 7 respondents
          indicated they use iCloud, 5 indicated they use DropBox, and another 5 stated they use Microsoft
          One Drive. The majority of respondents indicated they use cloud storage almost every day for
          personal use, however, about 24% said they mainly use cloud storage for work. This data not only
          confirmed that cloud storage services are in high demand, but it also identified a niche market
          of professionals who could potentially benefit from this solution.

          <p>
            Central inspires productivity and motivates creativity as a luxury online
            workspace and data storage solution. I've chosen to communicate that essence
            of value in the color pallet by using a dark grayish-blue, white, and a sharp
            pop of red as my primary colors. The brand itself aims to motivate users to
            produce high quality work (red) and inspire confidence as if their creations
            are worth millions (dark grayish-blue).
          </p>
          <p>
            While pondering the ideal typography for this project, I knew I wanted to
            incorporate thin, san serif fonts and shapes created from thin stokes into the
            design to keep the overall aesthetic simplistic. I also wanted the font to
            metaphorically connect back to the theme of creativity. In the end, I chose
            ParalucentStencil Light as my primary font to be used in the logo. Though
            ParalucentStencil communicates the theme of the brand well, the font is too
            overpowering and overwhelming to used on text heavy pages. Thus, I also chose
            Monsterrat Light to be used as headings and Acumin Pro Regular to be used for
            the body text. All three fonts paired well, eliciting a modern and professional
            appearance.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The research done in this project to create this solution has taught me a lot,
           enforcing the idea of designing with the user in mind. I’ve also have a better
           understanding of how brand messaging influences an over design. Initially, I
           tried incorporating illustrations into the design but found that it took away
           from a chic-professional appeal. I found it better to include photographs and
           geometric shapes to communicate professionalism while still inspiring creativity.
           Given more time, I would have thought out a plan to grow the collaboration and
           network feature. However, I find the CRM aspect of the solution a helpful tool
           that would be of value to professional creatives.
