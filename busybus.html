        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          For this design exercise, I was tasked with creating a mobile application called
          BusyBus that would provide public transit users with key information pertaining
          to their local city transit system. As part of this project, I conducted a user
          survey using Google forms and created a high fidelity mock-up using Figma.

      <div class="problem">
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Due to expansion, numerous bus routes added and many of those routes stop at the
          same bus stop. Consequently, bus riders need to know what the next arriving bus
          is and how much time they have to get to the bus stop.

        <h2>User Survey Results</h2>
        <p>
          17.4% reported that they’re very likely to ride the public bus and 21.7% states
          they are somewhat likely
        </p>
        <p>
          Route schedules, online trip planners, and tracking tools are most important
          amongst respondents
        </p>
        <p>
          21.7% of respondents often track the location /ETA of arriving buses while
          43.5% of users sometimes do
        </p>
        <p>
          39.1% of respondents are somewhat satisfied with their city’s public
          transportation system, while 34.8%  reported either not having  or having
          a neutral opinion

        <h2>Paper Prototype</h2>
        <p>
          While testing my three-screen paper prototype with three participants,
          I found that, as predicted, some features were more intuitive than others.
          For example, two-out-of-three participants easily identified the ‘Plan Trip’
          button when instructed to launch the trip planner, however, none of the
          participants understood the purpose of the ‘Quick Links’ feature. So, I went
          back to the drawing board and created a more simple and straightforward design.
          My second paper prototype is shown below.

          Changes made to achieve my final mock-up included expanding the background picture
          and making it appear more subtle by adding an overlay with a higher opacity,
          changing the navigation menu to better follow the iOS Guidelines, and addeding
          text captions under the menu icons. Doing so made the design overall more intuitive
          and easy visually appealing.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          BusyBus was the first project I completed as part of Bloc’s coding bootcamp.
          From this assignment, I learned how to utilize user research in a meaning way
          to create an everyday solution for communicating public transit information to
          users. After reciving feedback from prototype testing and helpful tips from Bloc’s
          grading team, I also picked up some helpful tips on how to keep a desing simple
          and asetheticly appealing while communicating necessary information.
